# Deployment to Digital Ocean


See first: [deployment.md](https://github.com/jessicarush/python-examples/blob/master/deployment.md)

These notes were made by patching together instructions from a FLASK RESTful-API course and various Digital Ocean tutorials. Since then, I've also made notes following the instructions from Miguel Grinberg's [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xvii-deployment-on-linux) which are located in the link above. I believe those instructions to be much clearer and simpler but I'm keeping these ones here for completeness. In addition, this doc describes creating a postgreSQL database, the other describes creating a MySQL database.

## Create a new Droplet

On Digital Ocean, servers are called *droplets*. To create a new server, find the 'create new droplet' option.

### Basic settings:

- **Choose an image:** This is the operating system that will be installed on the 'server'. Typically Ubuntu 16.04 x64 is the way to go. This is an 'LTS' (longterm support) distribution.
> Note: as of March 2019, Ubuntu 18.04 x64 is the default distro.
- **Choose a plan/size:** the smallest to start, you can always upgrade it later.
- **Add backups, block storage:** choose or leave blank
- **Choose a datacenter region:** choose closest to your users for speed.

### Additional options:

- **private networking:** allows droplets to communicate with each other without going through the internet.
- **IPv6:** default droplets run on IPv4
- **user data:** fancy cloud init feature
- **monitoring:** adds a droplet with metrics and monitoring features.

### Add your SSH keys

Highly recommended. If you haven't already added your SSH Keys to your account, do it first. It's much harder to add your keys to your droplet afterwards. It can be done, but its a bit more work... Basically you have to add your public key manually to the droplets `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

### Finalize and create

Choose how many droplets, pick a hostname. If you added an SSH key you should now be able to connect to the server via your own terminal:
```
$ ssh root@<the.droplets.ip.address>
```

If you didn't add SSH keys, you'll get emailed a big, long, nasty password. From the droplets dashboard, choose to 'Access Console' and you'll need to enter the username (root), that long, nasty password (twice), then your new password (twice).

Once connected, the first command you'll want to run is:
```
$ apt-get update
```

This tells apt (Ubuntu's pip) to check if there's anything already installed on the server that can be updated.


## Creating a New User

It's a good idea to create a new user on your server so you're not always using root. Root is a super user and should only be used when necessary.

```
$ adduser jessica
$ usermod -aG sudo jessica
$ su - jessica
```

This creates a new user and a new 'group', adds sudo privileges to the new user, then switches the the new user. Next you'll want to set up SSH for your new user. Start by manually copying your public key on your local machine:

```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then, back on the server in the users home directory, create an .ssh directory with the correct permissions and open a new file:

```
$ mkdir ~/.ssh
$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
$ nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Paste in your public key, hit CTRL-X to exit, Y to save the changes and ENTER to confirm the name. When that's done, restrict the permissions of the authorized_keys file:

```
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Modify some config settings:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make sure the following options are set:
```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

If you had to make changes here, be sure to CTRL-X, Y, ENTER, then:
```
$ sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

At this point you should be able to SSH to your droplet using the new user:
```
$ ssh jessica@<the.droplets.ip.address>
```

These instructions came from [Digital Ocean.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04)

## Installing sqlite3

The sqlite3 module is part of the standard Python library, so on a standard Ubuntu installation or any system with Python installed, no further installation is strictly necessary. To install the Sqlite command line interface on Ubuntu, use these commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

## Installing postgreSQL

```
$ apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

When you do this you'll see the following near the end of the installation:
```
Creating new cluster 9.5/main ...
config /etc/postgresql/9.5/main
data   /var/lib/postgresql/9.5/main
locale en_US.UTF-8
socket /var/run/postgresql
port   5432
```

Note that when we install postgresql, it also creates a new user on our digitalocean server. This new user is the owner of the postgresql installation. You'll want to switch over to that user:

```
$ sudo -i -u postgres
```

The command line prompt should reflect this switch:
```
postgres@droplet:~$
```

Connect to the database by entering the `psql` command. Note, the database will have the same name as the user: postgres  

You can confirm that by typing: `\conninfo`

If we wanted, we good now run sql commands here. To exit from the database, type: `\q`

To logout of the postgres user and return to root type: `exit`

## Creating and linking a new postgreSQL user

First SSH to the server, then sudo switch to the default postgres user:

```
$ ssh jessica@<the.droplets.ip.address>
$ sudo -i -u postgres
```
We now have to create a new postgres user and password:
```
$ createuser jessica -P
```

Create a new database for that user. By default when typing `psql` it will connect to a database that is the same name as the user. So, just use the same same for both to make things easier.

```
$ create db jessica
```

FYI, if you want to delete a database you can type the command `dropdb`. Now `exit` from the postgres user and try connecting to the new users database by typing `psql`. Again, to double check type `\conninfo` and `\q` to quit.

Note: postrges won't ask for a password when the db name is the same as the username which makes sense to me but SQALchemy requires you to have a password protected connection to your database. For this reason, make the following changes:
```
$ sudo vi /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf
```

scroll down to the following lines:
```
local   all             postgres                         peer
TYPE    DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS          METHOD
"local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                              peer
IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32     md5
IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128          md5
```
Note the column names: type, database, user, address, method.

The first line says if we are connecting locally we have access to all databases as the postgres user. Peer means *"obtain the client's operating system user name from the operating system and check if it matches the requested database user name. This method is only available for local connections".*

The next line says the same thing but for all other users. All other users have all access just like the postgres user.

The third and fourth lines say if users are connecting though the internet, all users have access to all databases but the md5 method says a password is required. Therefor, if you want to, you can change all local users to md5 as well. If you make changes here remember `i` to insert then `esc` and `:wq` to write and quit.

## Installing nginx & enabling a Firewall

NGINX is a free, open-source, HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. In layman's terms, it can act as a gateway between our app and external users. It will accept and direct incoming requests. We can configure it so that the request goes straight to our app. The reason we would want to use ngnix to do this is:
- it communicates well with uwsgi
- enables multi-threaded operations in our flask app
- allows you to run multiple flask apps simultaneously on a server.
- it can direct incoming requests to different apps based on some parameters.

Assuming you're logged into your server:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
```

We need to enable the firewall and allow nginx and SSH access:
```
$ sudo ufw status
$ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
$ sudo ufw allow https
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw status
```

If you check 'sudo ufw status' again, you should see both ngnix and SSH are allowed access. Note SSH is indicated as '22' (the port number that SSH uses). You could also allow SSH by saying 'sudo ufw allow 22'. Therefor, if you've configured your SSH daemon to use another port, just type that port number instead. FYI you can also allow ranges of ports and IP addresses.

See this [Digital Ocean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-16-04) for more information.

Check that nginx is running with the system controller:
```
$ systemctl status nginx
```

FYI you can also start and stop services like ngnix this way:
```
$ systemctl start nginx
$ systemctl stop nginx
$ systemctl restart nginx
```

## Configure nginx

At some point you'll need to configure nginx to work with (access) your app:
```
$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/<app-name>.conf
```

Insert the following:

```
server {
listen 80;
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;
server_name localhost;

location / {
include uwsgi_params;
uwsgi_pass unix:/var/www/html/<app-name>/socket.sock;
uwsgi_modifier1 30;
}

error_page 404 /404.html;
location = /404.html {
root /usr/share/nginx/html;
}

error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
location = /50x.html {
root /usr/share/nginx/html;
}
}
```
When you're done `esc` then, `:wq`. Here's a breakdown:

*listen 80;*
>default http port. Because its the default, we don't need to include it in our users get requests. Normally somewhere in the request string we'd need to have :5432 if that was our port.

*real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;*
>forwards the IP address of the requester to our flask app.

*set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;*
>after it forwards the IP address, it sets it to the local IP address

*location / {*
> whenever someone accesses the root location '/' of the server, they'll get redirected somewhere (our flask app).

*include uwsgi_params;*
>allows it to communicate with uwsgi which we're using in part because it allows our program to run multiple threads more efficiently and to restart threads if they fail. uwsgi is pretty complicated but these two apparently work well together.

*uwsgi_pass unix:/var/www/html/\<app-name>/socket.sock;*
>the connection point between our flask app and ngnix. socket.sock is a file we'll need to create shortly.

*uwsgi_modifier1 30;*
>tell threads when to die if they become blocked

*error_page 404 /404.html;*
>if there is a 404 error, the user will be redirected to this page

*location = /404.html {  
root /usr/share/nginx/html;*
>serve the 404.html file from this directory

Once you've made these changes to the <app-name>.conf file, you'll also need to enable it. The following creates a soft link between the config file and the sites-enabled directory:
```
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<app-name>.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Now we need to remove an nginx default. (This doesn't actually remove the file, it's just a link file, the actual file still lives in the 'sites-available' directory).

```
$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Note, reload will reload the configuration for nginx.


## Create directories, git clone your app from GitHub

Create the directory where the application files will be placed, give access to the user, and then cd into that directory. This is the same path we wrote in the config file:

```
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/html/<app-name>
$ sudo chown jessica:jessica /var/www/html/<app-name>
$ cd /var/www/html/<app-name>/
```

Clone our python app from github. Be sure to put a space followed by a period
after the url to indicate we want to clone into the current directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jessicarush/testing.git .
```

Make a log directory:
```
$ mkdir log
```

## Create a virtual env, install python and required packages

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python3-dev libpq-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install wheel
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set up uwsgi.ini

```
$ cd /var/www/html/<app-name>
$ vi uwsgi.ini
```

If we were using heroku, the file should look like this:
```
[uwsgi]
http-socket = :$(PORT)
master = true
die-on-term = true
module = app:app
memory-report = true
```

But with Digital Ocean we'll do this (`i` to insert):
```
[uwsgi]
base = /var/www/html/<app-name>
; if your start file is called run.py:
app = run
module = %(app)
home = %(base)/venv
pythonpath = %(base)
socket = %(base)/socket.sock
chmod-socket = 777
; change these if you want but there may be limits on the droplet:
processes = 4
threads = 4
; number of seconds before killing if a process/thread is stuck:
harakiri = 15
; app refers to the variable name in our flask app:
callable = app
logto = /var/www/html/<app-name>/log/%n.log
```
When done, `esc`, and `:wq`

Note in the above `%n` is a uwsgi magic variable for the filename.
See here for more information on [configuring uwsgi.](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration.html)

## Set up an ubuntu service

```
$ cd /var/www/html/<app-name>
```
So at this point in the above directory we should see our app, Procfile, requirements.txt, runtime.txt, uwsgi.ini, venv, and log directory. I haven't mentioned the Procfile or runtime.txt file here because I *believe* those are only needed for a heroku deployment but I might be wrong. For their contents see: [flask_notes.md](https://github.com/jessicarush/python-examples/blob/master/flask_notes.md#heroku)

Next we'll create an ubuntu "service". A service is a daemon that you can tell ubuntu to run when the server starts or restart if you need to apply an updated config file, etc. The service then runs something else (like uwsgi). A service also lets you do things like set environment variables.
```
$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/uwsgi_<app-name>.service
```

Insert the following:
```
[Unit]
Description=my uWSGI <app-name>

[Service]
Environment=DATABASE_URL=postgres://jessica:<mypassword>@localhost:5432/jessica
ExecStart=/var/www/html/<app-name>/venv/bin/uwsgi --master --emperor /var/www/html/<app-name>/uwsgi.ini --die-on-term --uid jessica --gid jessica --logto /var/www/html/<app-name>/log/emperor.log
Restart=always
KillSignal=SIGQUIT
Type=notify
NotifyAccess=all

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
When done, `esc`, and `:wq`

Note in the environment variable above, the last *'jessica'* is the name of the database.

Now we should be able to start our flask app by starting the service:
```
$ sudo systemctl start uwsgi_<app-name>
```

## Updating your app

If you've made changes to your app on your local machine, you'll need to git commit, push to github, then on the server do a git pull then restart the uwsgi_<app-name> process:

local machine:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'Description of changes'
$ git push -u origin master
```
server:
```
$ cd /var/www/html/<app-name>/
$ git pull
$ sudo systemctl start uwsgi_<app-name>
```

## Attaching a domain name to your digitalocean droplet

Once you've bought a domain, you can change the nameservers on it to point to Digital Ocean:
- ns1.digitalocean.com
- ns2.digitalocean.com
- ns3.digitalocean.com

You can also use a service like cloudflare to set up the DNS to connect to your servers ip. Cloudflare is a "content delivery network". Although, if you go to their website, they seem really precious about the fact that they aren't just a content delivery network. Essentially it can be used to sit in front of your server. You can do various things like store the site on their server to increase speed (I think they do this through caching so beware). They've got security features and things that prevent "denial of service attacks". You can set up SSL certificates through them as well.

The main thing is you need to change the nameservers from wherever you bought the domain to wherever your actually site lives. If you're using Digital Ocean's nameservers, you can go to your dashboard and choose Networking >
Domains. Then [follow the steps here.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean)

Basically what you end up doing is editing your domains DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT).
More information about [modifying your DNS records here.](https://school-of-code.gitbooks.io/rest-apis-with-flask-and-python/content/domains-and-https/modifying-our-dns-records.html)


## Setting up an SSL certificate (https://)

This is a three step process. First you need to get a certificate and a key. Then you need to copy those keys as files into your server directory. Lastly, you need to modify the ngnix config file.

1. **Getting the certificate & key:**  
This will be different depending on what "certificate authority" you're using. If cloudflare, you'd go to the 'crypto' tab. Then there a spot to enable SSL then lower down the page, create a certificate. When you create a certificate, it will give you two strings... an 'origin certificate' and a 'private key'. There may be an option for format, just use PEM (default).

2. **Copying the certificate/key to your server:**
```
$ ssh jessica@<your.droplet.ip>
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/ssl
$ sudo touch var/www/ssl/mydomain.com.pem
$ sudo touch var/www/ssl/mydomain.com.key
$ sudo vi var/www/ssl/mydomain.com.pem   (paste in the origin certificate)
$ sudo vi var/www/ssl/mydomain.com.key   (paste in the private key)
```

3. **Modify the ngnix config file:**
```
$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<app-name>.conf
```
before:
```
server {
listen 80;
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;
server_name localhost;
{more}
```
after:
```
server {
listen 443 default_server;
server_name mydomain.com;
ssl on;
ssl_certificate      var/www/ssl/mydomain.com.pem;
ssl_certificate_key  var/www/ssl/mydomain.com.key;
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;
{more}
```


Don't forget to reload ngnix whenever you make changes to the config.
```
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
You can leave it at that, but note that your site will only work on https:// and not on http://. If you want http as well, look into a redirect through cloudflare or wherever.

Another tutorial for [Installing SSL certificaltes here.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-an-ssl-certificate-from-a-commercial-certificate-authority)


## Troubleshooting

If you get locked out of SSH, try using the console.
See here to [set up a password for the console.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-console-to-access-your-droplet)

If you rebuild your droplet and you get a weird warning when you try to SSH again:
(WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!)
Delete the old info in your known hosts file by typing:
```
$ ssh-keygen -R <your.ip.address.here>
```

If you've made changes to your nginx config, don't forget to reload & restart, as wall as restart your app:
```
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ sudo systemctl restart uwsgi_<app-name>
```
