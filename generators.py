'''Generators'''


# A generator is a Python sequence creation object. With it you can iterate
# through huge sequences without creating and storing the entire sequence in
# memory at once. range() is an example of a generator. Every time you iterate
# over a generator, it keeps track of where it was the last time it was called
# and returns the next value. This is different from a normal function, which
# has no memory of previous calls and always starts at its first line in the
# same state. It's important to note that since generators don't store the
# whole range in memory (but generate on the fly), you can only iterate over
# a generator object once (however, the range class resets itself each time,
# so in its case, you can). That being said, you can always call a generator
# function again. Note that yield is used like return... it tells the
# function to return a generator.

# Here's an example of a generator function that would do what range() does:

def my_range(first=0, last=10, step=1):
    number = first
    while number < last:
        yield number
        # the yield statement marks the point where the function will return
        # to generate each item. Each time, it remembers it's previous value
        # when it returns. The generator doesn't actually start generating
        # until you iterate over it with a for loop or next().
        number += step

# The original function is a normal function:
print(type(my_range))
# <class 'function'>

# The result of the functions 'yield' keyword (instead of 'return')
# produces a generator object:
ranger = my_range(1, 5)
print(type(ranger))
# <class 'generator'>

# You can iterate over the generator object:
for x in ranger:
    print(x)
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4


# Reduced size
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example illustrates the size difference between generators and a full
# list equivalent (keep in mind these sizes are using up memory):

import sys

big_range = my_range(1, 10000)
# rememeber, range() is actually a generator

print('big_range is {} bytes'.format(sys.getsizeof(big_range)))
# big_range is 88 bytes

big_list = list(range(1, 10000))

print('big_list is {} bytes'.format(sys.getsizeof(big_list)))
# big_list is 90096 bytes


# Another Generator example
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example shows a function that opens and searches a file for text.
# The search words and the filename are entered as arguments. Each time
# We call the generator, it remembers where it left of and continues.

def search(keyword, filename):
    print('generator started')
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            if keyword in line:
                yield line

search_generator = search('Mama', 'data/bohemian_rhapsody_lyrics.txt')

# At this point, nothing is printed because the body code of the search
# function doesn't actually run. The generator function will only return a
# generator object. To make the generator run we need to do something like:

print(next(search_generator))  # generator started, Mama, just killed a man
print(next(search_generator))  # Mama, life had just begun
print(next(search_generator))  # Mama, ooo
print(next(search_generator))  # Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)


# Another Generator example
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

def fibonacci(n):
    curr = 1
    prev = 0
    counter = 0
    print('ok go')
    while counter < n:
        yield curr
        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr
        counter += 1

test_fibonacci = fibonacci(10)

for i in test_fibonacci:
    print(i)
# ok go
# 1
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 8
# 13
# 21
# 34
# 55


# Multiple Yields
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

def odds_generator():
    '''generate infinite odd numbers'''
    number = 1
    while True:
        yield number
        number += 2

def pi_series():
    '''generate Ï€ using Leibniz Formula
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80
    '''
    odds = odds_generator()
    approximation = 0
    while True:
        approximation += (4 / next(odds))
        yield approximation
        approximation -= (4 / next(odds))
        yield approximation

approx_pi = pi_series()

# The higher the range, the closer it gets to pi. Not really sure why this
# formula is useful because I'm not mathy, but the interesting point here
# is the multiple yields which execute in turn with each loop.

for x in range(100):
    print(next(approx_pi))
    # ...
    # ...
    # 3.1315929035585537


# generator.send(value)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Up to now, we have just iterated through generator with next() to get the
# value. Generators also have access to a .send() method which allows is to
# pass new data to the generator. This method is similar to next() in that it
# resumes the execution of the generator, but it also "sends" a value into the
# generator function. The value argument becomes the result of the current
# yield expression. The send() method then returns the next value yielded by
# the generator.

# The syntax is send() or send(value). Without any value, the send method is
# equivalent to a next() call. This method can also use None as a value.
# In both cases, the result will be that the generator advances its execution
# to the first yield expression.

# First, lets look at a basic example using the odd_generator from above:

def odds_generator():
    '''generate infinite odd numbers'''
    number = 1
    while True:
        x = yield number  # assigned the yield to a variable
        print(x, number)  # this will let us see what's happening
        number += 2

odds = odds_generator()

next(odds)
next(odds)
next(odds)
odds.send('Hello')
odds.send('Hi')
odds.send('Howdy')
# None 1
# None 3
# Hello 5
# Hi 7
# Howdy 9

# Here's another example. First lets look at it without the send value.
# As mentioned above, by default send() will just return the next value:

def times_ten_generator():
    number = 1
    while True:
        yield number * 100
        number += 1

tt = times_ten_generator()

print(next(tt))    # 100
print(next(tt))    # 200
print(next(tt))    # 300
print(tt.send(8))  # 400

# Now lets assign the yielded value to a value to be used with send().
# On the last line we've incremented the number so that it can be used
# with both next() and send().

def times_ten_generator():
    number = 1
    while True:
        x = yield number * 100
        number = x if x else number + 1

tt = times_ten_generator()
print(next(tt))      # 100
print(next(tt))      # 200
print(next(tt))      # 300
print(tt.send(8))    # 800
print(next(tt))      # 900
print(tt.send(0.5))  # 50.0
print(next(tt))      # 150.0
print(next(tt))      # 250.0


# generator.close()
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The .close() method allows us to shut down a generator early. This could
# be built in as part of some sort of error handling... say an error happens
# somewhere else and you want to reset the generator. If you try to iterate
# over a closed generator, you'll raise an Excpetion.

def odds_generator():
    '''generate infinite odd numbers'''
    number = 1
    while True:
        yield number
        number += 2

odds = odds_generator()

print(next(odds))    # 1
print(next(odds))    # 3
print(next(odds))    # 5
odds.close()
# print(next(odds))  # Exception: Stop Iteration
