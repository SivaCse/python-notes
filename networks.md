## Patterns

You can build networking applications from some basic patterns. The most common pattern is *request-reply* aka *client-server*. This pattern is synchronous in that the client waits for a server response.

Another common pattern is *push* or *fanout*. This is where you send data to any available worker in a pool of processes. An example is a web server behind a *load balancer*.

The opposite pattern to this is *pull* or *fanin* which accepts data from one or more sources. An example would be a logger that takes messages from multiple sources and writes then to a single file. Another pattern is...


## Publish-Subscribe Model

With this pattern, a publisher sends out data. In a simple pub-sub system, all subscribers would receive all the data, but more commonly, subscribers choose which data to receive (topics). Unlike the *push* pattern, more than one subscriber might receive a given piece of data. If there's no subscriber, the data is ignored. Publish-Subscribe is not a queue but a broadcast. Here's an example that uses a *Redis* server:

*redis_pub.py:*
```python
import random
import redis


conn = redis.Redis()
cats = ['siamese', 'black', 'persian', 'main coon', 'tabby', 'norwegian']
hats = ['bowler', 'fedora', 'top hat', 'poor boy', 'cowboy', 'stovepipe']

for i in range(10):
    cat = random.choice(cats)
    hat = random.choice(hats)
    print('Publish: {} cat wears a {}'.format(cat, hat))
    conn.publish(cat, hat)
```

*redis_sub.py:*
```python
import redis


conn = redis.Redis()
topics = ['siamese', 'black']
sub = conn.pubsub()
sub.subscribe(topics)

for msg in sub.listen():
    if msg['type'] == 'message':
        cat = msg['channel']
        hat = msg['data']
        print('Subscribe: {} cat wears a {}'.format(cat, hat))
```

The listen method returns a dictionary. If its type is 'message', it was sent by the publisher and matches our criteria. The 'channel' key is the topic (cat) and the data key contains the message (hat).

To test, first fire up a Redis server:

```
$ redis-server
```

Then, in another terminal start the subscriber, followed by the publisher. The subscriber needs to be listening before the publisher broadcasts. Note: you could also run these in separate terminal tabs/windows instead of using the `&`.

```
$ python3 redis_sub.py &
$ python3 redis_pub.py

Publish: tabby cat wears a cowboy
Publish: persian cat wears a poor boy
Publish: tabby cat wears a top hat
Publish: black cat wears a cowboy
Publish: siamese cat wears a top hat
Subscribe: b'black' cat wears a b'cowboy'
Publish: siamese cat wears a fedora
Subscribe: b'siamese' cat wears a b'top hat'
Publish: persian cat wears a cowboy
Subscribe: b'siamese' cat wears a b'fedora'
Publish: tabby cat wears a stovepipe
Publish: persian cat wears a cowboy
Publish: tabby cat wears a stovepipe
```

## TCP/IP

In the middle of the stacked layers of protocols that handle our internet connections, data exchanges and so on, is the IP protocol layer which specifies how network locations are addressed and how packets of data flow. Your local machine always has the IP address *127.0.0.1* and the name *localhost*. If connected to the internet, it will also have a public IP address. In the layer above the IP protocol, two protocols describe how to move bytes between locations:

**UDP** – (user datagram protocol) used for short exchanges. A tiny message sent in a single burst with no acknowledgment that the data was received. It's fast and light but unreliable in the sense that multiple messages may arrive out of order or not at all. Just saying.

**TCP** – (transmission control protocol) used for longer-lived connections. It sends streams of bytes and ensures they arrive in order without duplication. Most of the internet with which we interact (web, database servers, etc) is based on the TCP protocol running on top of the IP protocol–TCP/IP for short.


## Sockets

A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.

The following is an example of a simple client-server exchange. The client sends a string in a UDP datagram to a server and the server returns a packet containing a string. In each program we'll print the time and open a socket (address and port). The server will listen for connections to its socket. The client will write to the socket which transmits the message.

*udp_server.py:*
```python
import datetime
import socket


server_address = ('localhost', 4544)
max_size = 4096
print('Starting the server at', datetime.datetime.now())
print('waiting for client to call')

# This line creates a socket (AF_INET means we'll create an IP socket,
# SOCK_DGRAM means we'll send and receive datagrams - UDP):
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

# This listens for any data arriving at the IP, port. The programs sits and
# waits here until there's some action:
server.bind(server_address)

# Any data that comes in will be received here:
data, client = server.recvfrom(max_size)
print('Message:', datetime.datetime.now(), client, 'said', data)

# The server sends a reply:
server.sendto(b'Are you talking to me?', client)

# and closes the connection:
server.close()
```

*udp_client.py:*
```python
import datetime
import socket


server_address = ('localhost', 4544)
max_size = 4096
print('Starting the client at', datetime.datetime.now())

client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

client.sendto(b'Hello', server_address)

data, server = client.recvfrom(max_size)
print('Message:', datetime.datetime.now(), server, 'said', data)

client.close()
```

Note that the client doesn't need a bind, because it's not doing the listening. Also, the client needs to know the server address and port but doesn't need to specify one for itself...this is automatically assigned by the system.

Here's the same thing but sent via TCP:

*tcp_server.py:*
```python
import datetime
import socket


address = ('localhost', 4544)
max_size = 1000  # bytes
print('Starting the server at', datetime.datetime.now())
print('waiting for client to call')

# SOCK_DGRAM is replaced with SOCK_STREAM to use the streaming TCP protocol:
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind(address)

# This queues up to 5 client connections before refusing new ones:
server.listen(5)

# TCP gets the first available message as it arrives:
client, addr = server.accept()
data = client.recv(max_size)
print('Message:', datetime.datetime.now(), client, 'said', data)

client.sendall(b'Are you talking to me?')
client.close()
server.close()
```

*tcp_client.py:*
```python
import datetime
import socket


address = ('localhost', 4544)
max_size = 1000
print('Starting the client at', datetime.datetime.now())

client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# The connect() call sets up a stream
client.connect(address)
client.sendall(b'Hi there')
data = client.recv(max_size)
print('Message:', datetime.datetime.now(), 'someone replied', data)

client.close()
```

## Points to note

– **UDP** sends messages but their size is limited and not guaranteed to reach their destination.

– **TCP** sends streams of bytes, not messages. To send an entire message via TCP, you need extra information to reassemble the full message from its bytes segments (a fixed message size in bytes, the size of the full message, or some delimiting character). Because these are bytes, you need to use the python bytes type (not unicode text strings).

– **ZeroMQ** is a good library for working with sockets. Does a bit more: <http://zguide.zeromq.org/?>
