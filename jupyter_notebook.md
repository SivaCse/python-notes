# Jupyter Notebook


Jupyter Notebook is a hybrid editor and interactive shell that runs in the browser. It works really well for exploring large sets of data. It does not replace your regular editor or IDE (which is more useful for working with multiple files and projects) but definitely worth considering if you need to explore your datasets and test your code before implementing.

```
$ pip3 install jupyter
```

If you intend on working with excel files, you should also install:

```
$ pip3 install xlrd
```

Once installed, start a jupyter session by navigating to your working directory in the command line, then launch:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will launch a jupyter session in a new browser window. You will see all your files listed from your current working directory.

From the dropdown in the top right corner, choose to create a new python notebook. Python is listed as the only type of notebook because we installed jupyter via python with pip. This opens a new untitled tab. When you give it a name and you'll see a new .ipynb file and folder show up in your working directory. The .ipynb file allows you to return to your previous saved session (follow the same steps to launch jupyter, but instead of creating a new session, select the .ipynb file).

The editable field here is the shell. You can enter in as many lines of code as you want. Hitting the return key will not execute the code. When you are ready to execute hit `ctrl + return`.

At this point you can continue to edit the code in the first shell 'cell', or you can create a new 'cell' by hitting `option/alt + return`. You can execute your code and immediately create a new 'cell' with `shift + return`.

- To remove a 'cell', press `esc`, then `dd`
- To add a cell without executing press `esc`, then `b`

You can find more shortcuts under the help menu.

To view data try this; in a new jupyter 'cell':
```python
import pandas
```

In a second cell:
```python
df = pandas.read_csv('data/supermarkets.csv')
df
```

When you execute the second cell, you should see the data displayed in a friendly, easy-to-read table. Note the header rows in CSV files are shown in bold text. Try setting the header arg to None to see the difference:

```python
df1 = pandas.read_csv('data/supermarkets.csv', header=None)
```

Another nice feature of jupyter is the ability to get help on methods or classes by typing a question mark:
```python
df.set_index?
```

This will open a window with detailed help... really nice.

When you are finished working, logout of the browser windows. Back in the command line window, `CTRL-c`, then enter `y` to quit:
```
The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
http://localhost:8888/?token=d1ac3...
Shutdown this notebook server (y/[n])? y
[C 10:16:08.918 NotebookApp] Shutdown confirmed
