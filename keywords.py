'''Python Keywords'''


# The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or keywords of the
# language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. If you absolutely
# feel for clarity that you must use one of these names for your own variable,
# an accepted format to follow the name with an underscore. For example: from_

import keyword

for word in keyword.kwlist:
    print(word)

# False
# None
# True
# and
# as
# assert
# async
# await
# break
# class

# def
# del

# global
# if
