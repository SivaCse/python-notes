# The interface of Rental and Purchase is similar to that used for House and

# This is slightly surprising, as the class on its own has neither an __init__
# nor display method. Because both parent classes appropriately call super in
# these methods, we only have to extend those classes and the classes will
# behave in the correct order. This is not the case with prompt_init, of
# course, since it is a static method that does not call super, so we
# implement this one explicitly.

# NOTE: the order of the inherited classes here (Rental, House) is important.
# When display() is called on HouseRental, it goes to the Rental version of
# the method first, which then calls super.display() to get the House version,
# which again calls super.display() to get the property version. If we switched
# the order, display would refer to the House class's display(). When super
# is called there it goes directly to the method on the Property parent class.
# This means Rental class's display method never gets called! You might think
# we could have added a super call to Property.display(), but that will fail
# because the next superclass of Property is Object, and Object doesn't have
# a display method. Given this logic, I'm not sure how the super().display()
# in Rental routes over to House and not Object but there you have it. If you
# are uncomfortable with this, you could always resolve this be having Rental
# and Purchase extend the Property class as well instead of deriving directly
# from object.

# The moral of the story: Methods on parent classes can be called using super
# and argument lists must be formatted safely for these calls to work when
# using multiple inheritance!


# How it works so far:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The idea is first you would run the prompt_init static method to collect
# the information via input and return a dictionary of all the key/values
# (attributes) for the property. Then, you pass that dictionary to the actual
# new object:

info = HouseRental.prompt_init()

house1 = HouseRental(**info)

house1.display()

# Instead though, we'll put this in an Agent class which will be responsible
# for creating new listings and displaying existing ones.
