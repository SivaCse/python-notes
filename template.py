# Explanation: The above is a recommended example source code file header.
# The main things to note here:

# 1. The first line of each file should be #!/usr/bin/env python (or the path
#    to wherever your installation is... see which python3 for your path).
#    This makes it possible to run the file as a script invoking the
#    interpreter implicitly, (basically, just type $ ./template.py in the
#    command line instead of $ python3 template.py). Note that the file
#    permissions need to allow for the file to be executeable. For example,
#    the command $ sudo chmod 744 template.py, would give the file the
#    permissions: -rwxr--r-- 

# 2. Next should be the docstring with a description. If the description is
#    long, the first line should be a short summary that makes sense on its
#    own, separated from the rest by a newline.

# 3. Third should be all the import statements. Standard library first, then
#    third-party libraries, then your own modules.

# 4. OPTIONAL: Authorship information. Note that many feel this information
#    should be kept out of the source file and kept in its own file(s) such
#    as AUTHORS and LICENSE. Status should typically be one of "Prototype",
#    "Development", or "Production". More information can be found here:
