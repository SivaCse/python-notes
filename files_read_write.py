'''Reading and Writing Files'''


# Persistence
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data
# survives after the process with which it was created has ended. In other
# words, for data to be considered persistent, it must write to non-volatile
# storage such as a disk (as opposed to memory).

# The simplest kind of persistence is a plain old file, sometimes called a flat
# file. This is just a sequence of bytes stored under a filename. You read from
# a file into memory and write from memory to a file.


# File Handling Basics
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Before reading or writing a file, you need to open it:

fileobject = open('filename.txt', 'w')

# The arg after the filename is the mode. The letter indicates the operation:

# r  read - default mode if not specified
# w  write - if file doesn't exist, it's created. If exists, it's overwritten
# x  write - but only if the file does not already exist
# a  append - write after the end if the file exists

# An optional second letter after mode indicates the file type:

# t   text  - default type if not specified
# b   binary

# After opening a file, you call functions to read or write data, then you need
# to close the file:

fileobject.close()


# Close files automatically
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# using: with expression as variable

# If you forget to close a file that you've opened, you can end up wasting
# system resources or accidentally overwriting a file. Python has 'context
# managers' to deal with things such as open files:

with open('filename.txt', 'r') as fileobject:
    pass

# After the block of code completes (normally or by a raised exception),
# the file is closed automatically. This is the preferred way of
# opening/closing files.


# write()
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This writes the contents of text to the file testfile1:

with open('testfile1.txt', 'w') as fob:
    fob.write(text1)

# If you have a very large source string, you can write it in chunks
# (because a very large source could be quite taxing on memory, or
# impossible if the data was source was say a 25GB):

size = len(text2)
offset = 0
chunk = 100

with open('testfile1.txt', 'w') as fob:
    while True:
        if offset > size:
            break
        fob.write(text2[offset: offset + chunk])
        offset += chunk

# Test 'x' with our own exception handler:

try:
    fob = open('testfile1.txt', 'x')
    fob.write('stuff')
except FileExistsError:
    print('testfile1 file already exists!')


# print() to a file
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You can also print to a text file. Note: when typing out file=fileobject,
# it's the convention to NOT have spaces around the equals sign because
# these are named arguments as opposed to variable assignments.

with open('testfile2.txt', 'w') as fob:
    print(text1, file=fob)

# When printing additional data to a file you'll get a space between each
# argument and a newline at the end. These are due to the following arguments:

# sep (separator, which defaults to a space ' ')
# end (end string, which defaults to a newline '\n')

# If you want to change these print() defaults:

with open('testfile2.txt', 'w') as fob:
    print(text1, file=fob, sep='', end='')


# read()
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# read() reads all contents of the file and returns a single string

with open('testfile1.txt', 'r') as fob:
    poem = fob.read()

print(type(poem))  # <class 'str'>

# You can provide a max character count for how much is read in at a time.
# The following will read 100 characters at a time and append each chunk to
# the string:

poem = ''
with open('testfile1.txt', 'r') as fob:
    chunk = 100
    while True:
        fragment = fob.read(chunk)
        # As you read, Python keeps track of where the pointer is in the file.
        if not fragment:
            break
        poem += fragment

# After you've read all the way to the end, further calls to read() will
# return an empty string (''), which is treated as False in 'if not fragment'.
# This breaks out of the while True loop.


# readline()
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# this example does the same as above but feeds one line at a time instead of
# chunks of 100 characters:

poem = ''
with open('testfile1.txt', 'r') as fob:
    while True:
        line = fob.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        poem += line

print(type(line))  # <class 'str'>

# Another approach:

with open("testfile1.txt", 'r') as fob:
    line = fob.readline()
    while line:
        print(line, end='')
        line = fob.readline()  # moves to the next line


# Read a file by iterating
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The easiest way to read a text file is by using an iterator. This returns
# one line at a time... similar to previous examples but less code:

poem = ''
with open('testfile1.txt', 'r') as fob:
    for line in fob:
        poem += line

# a variation:

with open("testfile1.txt", 'r') as fob:
    for line in fob:
        if "by" in line.lower():
            print(line, end='')

# The Gashlycrumb Tinies - by Edward Gorey
# B is for Basil assaulted by bears.
# F is for Fanny, sucked dry by a leech.
# H is for Hector, done in by a thug.
# J is for James who took lye, by mistake.
# R is for Rhoda, consumed by a fire.
# X is for Xerxes, devoured by mice.


# Example: read(), write() and iteration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# this example opens each file in a list and writes it's content to one new
# file and names it with todays date and time.

import datetime

filename = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M-%S')
files = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']

with open(filename + '.txt', 'w') as fob1:
    for f in files:
        with open(f) as fob2:
            fob1.write(fob2.read())


# readlines() *plural
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# readlines() - the previous examples read and build up a single string.
# This call reads a line at a time and returns a list of one-line strings:

with open('testfile1.txt', 'r') as fob:
    lines = fob.readlines()
    print('Lines read: ', len(lines))  # Lines read:  29
    for line in lines:
        print(line, end='')

print(type(lines))  # <class 'list'>

# with readlines() you can go from the last line to the first:

with open("testfile1.txt", 'r') as fob:
    lines = fob.readlines()
    for line in lines[::-1]:
        print(line, end='')

# NOTE: If you tried using fob.read() or fob.readline() in the above, all the
# letters would be printed in reverse, not just the lines.


# eval()
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problems can arise when trying to read data structures from files. Example:

unkle = ('The Road, Pt. 1', 'UNKLE', '2017', (
         (1, 'Inter 1'),
         (2, 'Farewell'),
         (3, 'Looking for the Rain'),
         (4, 'Cowboys or Indians')))

with open('music.txt', 'w') as music_file:
    print(unkle, file=music_file)

# the problem here is that there's no easy way to read the data in the file
# back in as a tuple because it's now just a string with brackets. That's when
# eval() can help:

with open('music.txt', 'r') as music_file:
    music_contents = music_file.readline()

unkle = eval(music_contents)

print(type(unkle))                   # <class 'tuple'>
album, artist, year, tracks = unkle  # tuple unpacking
print(album)                         # The Road, Pt. 1
print(tracks[3])                     # (4, 'Cowboys or Indians')


# Binary Files
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Write a Binary file:

bdata = bytes(range(0, 256))

with open('testbinary', 'wb') as fob:
    fob.write(bdata)

# as with text you can write binary in chunks:

size = len(bdata)
offset = 0
chunk = 100

with open('testbinary', 'wb') as fob:
    while True:
        if offset > size:
            break
        fob.write(bdata[offset: offset + chunk])
        offset += chunk

# read() a Binary file:

with open('testbinary', 'rb') as fob:
    bdata = fob.read()


# seek(), tell()
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reminder: As you read and write, Python keeps track of where you are in
# the file. The tell() function returns your current offset position in
# bytes. The seek() function lets you jump to another offset in the file.
# This means you don't have to read every byte in a file to read the last one.
# Note: seek() also returns the current offset.

with open('testbinary', 'rb') as fob:
    fob.tell()          # returns 0
    fob.seek(255)       # moves to one byte before the end of the file
    bdata = fob.read()  # reads the last byte
    len(bdata)          # returns 1

# You can call seek() with a second argument: seek(offset, origin)
# If origin is 0 (the default), move offset bytes from the start
# If origin is 1, move offset bytes from the current position
# If origin is 2, move offset bytes relative to the end

# So to get to the last byte we could also do:

with open('testbinary', 'rb') as fob:
    fob.seek(-1, 2)

# These functions are most useful for binary files. Though you can use them
# with text files, you would have a hard time calculating offsets as the
# most popular encoding (UTF-8) uses varying numbers of bytes per character.
# That being said, a simple fob.seek(0) can be useful for moving your pointer
# back to the beginning of the file.


# truncate()
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# filename.truncate() - Empties the file
