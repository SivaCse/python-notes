'''If Statements and Conditional Tests'''


# At the heart of every if statement is an expression that can be evaluated as
# True or False and this is called a conditional test (also called a boolean
# expression). If the conditional test evaluates as True, python will execute
# the code following the if statement, otherwise it will be ignored.

cars = ['ford', 'bmw', 'honda', 'subaru']

# checking for equality:
for car in cars:
    if car == 'bmw':
        print(car.upper())
    else:
        print(car.title())

# checking for inequality:
for car in cars:
    if car != 'bmw':
        print(car.title())
    else:
        print(car.upper())

# Both produce the same result:
# Ford
# BMW
# Honda
# Subaru


# if, elif, else chains

age = 42

    admission = 0
elif age < 19:
    admission = 5
elif age >= 65:
    admission = 3
else:
    admission = 10

print(admission)  # 10

# Note you are not required to have a final else statement. It may be more
# readable to use another elif. Keep in mind if you do it this way, there is no
# catchall at the end, so the value must meet one of the elif conditions or it
# may raise an exception.

    admission = 0
elif age < 19:

if user not in users:

    print('Hello', user.title())
