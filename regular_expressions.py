# Regular Expressions using the standard module re

import re

# Define a pattern string, and a source string to compare against.
# match() checks whether the source begins with the pattern.

r = re.match('You', 'Young Frankenstein')

# 'You' is the pattern 'Young Frankenstein' is the source

print(r)

# For more complex matches, you can compile your pattern first to speed up the match later:

pattern = re.compile('You')

# Then, you can perform your match against the compiled pattern:

r = pattern.match('Young Frankenstein')

# Here's another way:

source = 'blue red green yellow blueish blue'
r = re.match('blue', source)
if r:
    print(r.group())

# In the following, m returns nothing because match only checks out if the beginning of 
# the source matches:

r = re.match('green', source)
if r:
    print(r.group())

# search() returns the first match, if any.

r = re.search('green', source)
if r:
    print(r.group())

# . means any character
# * means any number of the preceding character
# .* says there can be any amount of any characters before

r = re.match('.*green', source)
if r:
    print(r.group())

# findall() returns a list of all non-overlapping matches, if any.

r = re.findall('blue', source)
print(r)
print('Found', len(r), 'matches')

# this says find 'e' followed by any character:

r = re.findall('e.', source)
print(r)

# The above will not return the last e because no character follows it. 
# Indicate the charcter after 'e' is optional with '?':

r = re.findall('e.?', source)
print(r)

# split() splits the source at using the pattern as the split point and returns a list of 
# the string pieces.

r = re.split(' ', source)
print(r)

# sub() takes another replacement argument, and changes all parts of source that are matched 
# by pattern to the replacement.

r = re.sub('blue', 'black', source)
print(r)

# Special characters

# \d a single digit
# \D a single non-digit
# \w an alphanumeric character
# \W an non-alphanumeric character
# \s a whitespace character
# \S a non-whitespace character
# \b a word boundary (the beginning or end of a word)
# \B a non-word boundary (not the beginning or end of a word)

Is this the real Life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy.
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

# which characters are digits, letters or underscore:

# There are a few cases in which the regular expression pattern rules conflict with the 
# Python string rules. The following pattern should match any word that begins with b:

r = re.findall('\bb', sample)
print(r)

# In the mini-language of regular expressions \b means the beginning or end of a word but 
# in Python strings it means backspace. Avoid the accidental use of escape characters by 
# using Pythonâ€™s "raw strings" when you define your regular expression string. Always put 
# an r character before your regular expression pattern string, and Python escape characters 
# will be disabled:

r = re.findall(r'\bb', sample)
print(r)

# The above isn't very helpful as we only get the 'b' part of the match. 
# This says, find all complete words that start with the letter 'b'

r = re.findall(r'\bb\w*', sample)
print(r)

# breakdown:
# \b    - indicates the beginning of a word
# b     - starts with b
# \w*   - followed by any number of alphanumeric characters

# This says, find all words that start with the letter 'b' or 'B'

r = re.findall(r'\b[bB]\w*', sample)

# This says, find all 5 letter words that with 'b' or 'B'

r = re.findall(r'\b[bB]\w\w\w\w\b', sample)

r = re.findall(r'\b[bB]\w{4}\b', sample)
print(r)

# Find all words that end in the letter 'r':

r = re.findall(r'\b\w*r\b', sample)
print(r)

# Doesn't work well for words ending in 't' on account of apostrophes aren't matched by \w
# This says match any number of letters or apostrophes: [\w']*

# abc?                c is optional, a(bc)? means bc is optional
# abc*                c (and repetitions of c) is optional, will return ab, abc, abcccc
# abc*?               zero or more c, as few as possible, will return ab

# find words that contain 3 vowels in a row:

print(r)

# Match Output

# When using match() or search(), all matches are returned from the result object 
# r as r.group(). If you enclose a pattern in parentheses, the match will be saved 
# to its own group, and a tuple of them will be available as r.groups(), as shown here:

r = re.search(r'(escape).*(reality)', sample)

print(r.group())
print(r.groups())
