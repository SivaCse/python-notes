# python-examples

In my endeavor to learn Python, I'll be collecting my notes and example code here for reference and review purposes.  
To date, my training is self-guided through the use of text books and online resources. Some examples and comments 
may come from the following:

– 'Python Crash Course' – Eric Matthes  
– 'Introducing Python' - Bill Lubanovic    
– 'The Python 3 Standard Library by Example' – Doug Hellmann   
– 'Effective Python' – Brett Slatkin  
– 'Complete Python Masterclass' – Tim Buchalka, Jean-Paul Roberts  
– 'The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications'  
– 'Think Python' - Allen B. Downey  
– 'Learn Python the Hard Way" - Zed A. Shaw  
– Python documentation - https://docs.python.org/3/index.html
