In my endeavor to learn python, I'll be collecting some notes and example code here for reference and review purposes.
To date, my training is self-guided through the use of text books and online resources including:

'Complete Python Masterclass' – Tim Buchalka, Jean-Paul Roberts  
'Introducing Python' - Bill Lubanovic  
'Python Crash Course' – Eric Matthes  
'The Python 3 Standard Library by Example' – Doug Hellmann  
'Effectice Python' – Brett Slatkin  
'Think Python' - Allen B. Downey  
'Learn Python the Hard Way" - Zed A. Shaw  
Python documentation - https://docs.python.org/3/index.html  

Very special thanks to Scott Volk for the unending explanations, knowledge and support  - https://github.com/aleph2c
