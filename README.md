Examples of beginner-level python3 code

In my independent endeavor to learn python, I'll be collecting some bits of code here for reference and review purposes.
To date my training is completly self-guided through the use of text books and online references. It is my intention to measure what I have learned by committing to some online training as well. If this continues to be a thing that I'm interested in and good at, I'll also be looking at formal education.
