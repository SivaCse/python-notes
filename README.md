Notes for beginner-level python3

In my independent endeavour to learn python, I'll be collecting some bits of code here for reference and review purposes.
To date, my training is self-guided through the use of text books and online resources including:

'Introducing Python' - Bill Lubanovic  
'Think Python' - Allen B. Downey  
'Learn Python the Hard Way" - Zed A. Shaw  
Python documentation - https://docs.python.org/3/index.html  
Very special thanks to Scott Volk for the unending help, knowledge and support  - https://github.com/aleph2c
